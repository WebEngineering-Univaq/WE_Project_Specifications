{#specifiche}

Project *InfoOrientamento* requires the creation of a website to provide information to the secondary school students that are interested in studying computer science (CS) in our University. The information required by this project should be gathered from the students' guide, computer science website, etc.

-------
{#operazioni}

- The "students' guide" section of the site must present, in a simple and captivating way, the points that follow. It may also be useful to create different sets of information for students coming from different kinds of secondary school.
   1. What is (and what is not!) the CS.
   2. What *"study computer science"* means.
   3. The job opportunities for a graduated CS student.
   4. The university (where it is, which services it offers, etc.).
   5. The CS degree (organization, degree types, etc. )
- The site must contain information on the main CS degree courses (*what will I have to study?* ), especially those that are mandatory and/or placed in the first year, and on some advanced/interesting courses (*what will I be able to learn?* ). The information above could include a description of the course objectives, prerequisites and syllabus, sample course material, etc. This information should be updatable through a simple *backoffice* or, when possible, automatically captured from the university website.
- A site section must list and explain all the prerequisites needed to begin studying CS, e.g. basic mathematical skills, etc. In order to allow students to self-evaluate, these pages should contain a short online test: at the end of such test, based on the user's answers, the site could suggest some arguments to study before starting with CS.
- A site section must explain how to enrol to the CS degree: modules to compile, important dates, etc.
- For secondary schools wanting to present CS to their students, the site must keep a list of the programmed guided visits to the university and offer a form to request a visit of a CS representative directly to the school.
- The site must also offer some logistic information like how to reach the university, timetables of buses and trains, how to reach a specific building/classroom, etc.
- Finally, the site should contain an interactive section, where students may register and publish ads in specific categories like room offers, transport offers, etc. and a (simple) forum to exchange opinions and indications about CS and the university. The site must offer a suitable public search engine to look up for specific ads and messages.
